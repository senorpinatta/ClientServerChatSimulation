# ClientServerChatSimulation
A client-server application.

# Program Description
Suppose you are in a place, café or restaurant, in which there is only internet connectivity via a single server owned by that place, and the administration staff provides visitors with access codes with different categories. This is often referred to as Hotspot/Relay or Proxy. This program simulates the interaction between the server/relay that provides internet connectivity service in categories, based on the provided access code, to clients. The server monitors clients’ usage, and once a client finishes the quota, the connection will be closed. The server can serve a limited number of clients concurrently.
